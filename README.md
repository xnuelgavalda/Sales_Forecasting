# Project: Sales Forecasting

> The goal of this project is compile the information recently collected about time series forecasting, implement that knowledge into a particular case and finally produce a [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) dashboard to show the main results.

## General Information

The goal of this project is to forecast a sales time series using classic forecasting and Machine Learning algorithms:

- Statistical tools for time series
- Single, Double and Triple Exponential Smoothing
- ARIMA family: SARIMA
- Decomposition
- Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation plots
- Stationarity using Dicker-Fuller test
- SARIMA model
- Residuals analysis
- Prophet
- Machine Learning Models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
- Machine Learning feature creation techniques: time lags, date features, target encoding

The most relevant results are shown in an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

## main Technologies Used

- Python 3.8.18
- Streamlit 1.28.0
